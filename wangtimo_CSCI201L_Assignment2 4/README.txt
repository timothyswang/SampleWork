Hi! Thanks for looking at my code!

I just want to note that the fonts
from the Google Drive don't load
on Google Chrome. It works in Eclipse, but
I just wanted to let you know because
one of the TA's on the discussion
board for this project told us to
mention that the fonts won't load in
Chorme in a README file.

Additionally, I have been having problems with
my Tomcat server randomly not working as I have
been working on this project. For instance, it
would sometimes randomly not be syncrhonized
anymore for no apparent reason. So instead of being
 [Started, Synchronized], it would be [Started, Restart]
 and it will spew out 404 errors and other random errors. Once I stop and restart
the server, everything works. I talked with a
CP about it and she told me not to worry too much about it
and just to mention it here.

Just let me know if there's some other problem.

Thank you so much!
